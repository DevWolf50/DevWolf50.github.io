title: Personal Blog
subSummary: To create a clean and minamalistic blog to share my thoughts and experiences
website: "imjoepal.com/blog"
goalConcept: I wanted to create a very clean and simple blog that was uncluttered and distraction free. The blog was built to be extremely easy and simple to navigate.
motivationFeeling: The blog was built for users curious about me and users wanting to learn from my experiences.  The feelings I wanted the site to invoke were trust, awe, and enlightened.
motivationExamplePic: "pic"
lookFeel: To help achieve the clean and minamalistic feel I used very basic colors":" White and dark grey. To add a little pop and to alert users of an ineraction I used a vibrant blue. Plenty of white space focusses the attention to the content. The font, size and letter spacing is optimized for the best reading experince.<br> I use alot of material design to add depth to the website and so the elements feel like they are popping out a little. Big header pictures, high quality post pictures and use of icons add to the modern feel and creates a good sense of imagery.
engineering: The sites interactions are built with jquery, vanilla javscript and is built with jekyll. The interaction play an important part because, it makes the site very simple to navigate and allow the user to feel like they are on the same page. Animations help the user understand what is happening, keeps their attention and adds delight.
finalProduct: Though the site went through a couple of iterations I'm very pleased with the final product and feel it accomplishes the modern look and feel. I continue to improve and innovate it as I learn new things.
