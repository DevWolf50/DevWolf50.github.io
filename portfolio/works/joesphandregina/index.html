subSummary: A cute anniversary website for my wife and I
website: "josephandregina.com"
goalConcept: My wife's and I 5 year anniversary was coming up and I wanted to suprise her with a fully responsive website that showed her my unwavering love. Though I also knew others such as friends and family would be visiting as well. So I prepped users to be there no longer than 5 minutes.
motivationFeeling: I wanted my users to feel happy, awed, happy anf love. I organzied the content to summarize our 5 years together and then shared with them the most cherrished moments and quotes in those 5 years.
motivationExamplePic: "pic"
lookFeel: I went for a fun/cute look and feel and chose pastel colors that helped extend those feelings. I wnet for something new and chose a darker background. I used icons to help users relate to the content and to add some fun to the page. I also shared images of my wife and I to make it personal and to help users feel personal as well. Material designed was used to help draw attention to important content and to help users know what they could interact with. Large images, thin font, and colors helped give a modern look to the website.
engineering: All the user interactions are built using jquery and vanilla javascript. This was critical to bring life to the website and to allow users to feel excited as they were in control of pushing new moments and events into view. I built the logic with readability and reusability in mind.
finalProduct: TThe site was a success. My wife was suprised and excited that I had built a custom website. Our friends and family were also happy and excited that they were able to interact and share this special milestone in our marriage.
