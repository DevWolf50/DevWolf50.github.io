layout: works
title: SaltLakeSwimLeague.com
subSummary: Building a website that would set the digital image and brand of a new local swim league.
website: "saltlakeswimleague.com"
goalConcept: The primary goal was to create a simple and beautiful website where user could come and spend no more than 2 to 5 minutes gathering information about the league.
motivationFeeling: Users that would be visting the site would be new users interested in the league, parents of current swimmers, current swimmers and sponsors.<br> We wanted to cater to these users by delivering a modern site that would invoke feelings of trust, excitement, and confidence.
motivationExamplePic: "pic"
lookFeel: I chose a color pallete that would cultivate those feelings and that would be associated with swimming: shades of blue, grey, white and red. I used flat design and a little bit of material design to give the website depth. I used big header and section pictures along with plenty of white space to give it a clean and minimalistic feel and look.
engineering: The interactions with the website is built using pure vanilla javascript. I wanted to remove the abstraction layer of using jquery and wanted to manipulate the DOM directly. The logic is written to be clear and reasubale. 
finalProduct: The final product was a success and the client is very pleased with the direction I took. They strongly feel that we have set the standard for swim league websites.
