layout: works
title: SaltLakeSwimLeague.com
subSummary: A web platform dedicated to bringing clarity to the everchaning web development scene
website: "webHub.com"
goalConcept: The primary goal of the website is to display information about popular web development tools. A futuristc color pallete was used to extend the branding. I specifically designed the UI to be simple and intuitve
motivationFeeling: The platform was designed for users to feel excited and relived
motivationExamplePic: "pic"
lookFeel: I decided to go with the branding image to a space station; so the design reflects that to the core. I used a futuristic color pallete and gave it more of a rustic space feel
engineering: The website is built on angular and the content is dynamic to the core. The engineering simulates processing JSON data received by a server.
finalProduct: The final website is far from being done but, I feel great about the demo version. The ground work has been set and I'll continue to mold and shape this into a full solution
