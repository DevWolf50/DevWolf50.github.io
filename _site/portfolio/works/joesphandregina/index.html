          <!--Design Section -->
          <content>
            <h2>The Look and Feel</h2>
            <p>I went for a fun/cute look and feel and chose pastel colors that helped extend those feelings. I wnet for something new and chose a darker background. I used icons to help users relate to the content and to add some fun to the page. I also shared images of my wife and I to make it personal and to help users feel personal as well. Material designed was used to help draw attention to important content and to help users know what they could interact with. Large images, thin font, and colors helped give a modern look to the website.</p>

          <!--Development Section -->
          <content>
            <h2>The Engineering</h2>
            <p>All the user interactions are built using jquery and vanilla javascript. This was critical to bring life to the website and to allow users to feel excited as they were in control of pushing new moments and events into view. I built the logic with readability and reusability in mind.</p>
