          <!--Goal Section-->

            <h2>Goal/Concept</h2>
            <p>The primary goal of the website is to display information about popular web development tools and to help user locate the best solution for their problem or project. A futuristc color pallete was used to extend the branding. I specifically designed the UI to be simple and intuitve</p>

          <!--Motivation Section -->
          <content>
            <h2>Motivation/feeling</h2>
            <p>The motivation of users coming to the site would include":" those wanting to learn how to program but didnt know where to start, programmers looking for a new tool or language to use, those confused which tools are the best and finally those wanting to know which languages and tools are in high demand in the job market. <br> The incoming feelings expected are confusion, uncertainty, fustration, and curosity. The feelings during and after should be releaved, trust, confidence, a sense of direction and joy.<br> The site accomplishes this by displaying the tools in a way where It's very easy to compare metrics and understand which tools the comminuty perfers. It then brings in the top recources and community knoweldge of that tool in one spot. Truly making it a one stop shop for all things web development.</p>

          <!--Design Section -->
          <content>
            <h2>The Look and Feel</h2>
            <p>My process starts with drawing mockups on paper; this helps me to postion and to think up the main UI elements. Then from there I utilize sketch 3 to fine tune the wireframes into high fidelity mockups. This is where the design starts to appear. Since the website is being compared to a space station I decided to try something bold and go with a rustic spacey feeling. I chose a color pallete that I felt best extended that feeling. Flat design is used in the main framework but, I also incorported elements of material design to help users differenciate what is clickable and what is not and to help give the website some depth.<br> I then translate those mockups into a working site using Sass. Throughout the process I constantly take advantage of the variables, mixins and logic that are accessible in Sass. I also built my own grid and make my styles component focused with reuseability at the forefront of my desicions.</p>

          <!--Development Section -->
          <content>
            <h2>The Engineering</h2>
            <p>The website is built on angular and the content is dynamic to the core. The engineering simulates processing JSON data received by a server and then transporting that data to the view. The site is also engineered to receive and store data from the user such as reviews, tool likes, and profile information. I utilize many of Angular's directives as well as building my own custom directives to extend and make the HTML more understandable.</p>

          <!--Conclusion Section -->
          <content>
            <h2>The Final Product</h2>
            <p>It was fun to learn and utilize Angular while building this project. This helped me to continue to grow my understanding of javascript and it's robust functionality. The final website is far from being done but, I feel great about where the demo version is. The ground work has been set and I'll continue to mold and shape this into a full solution.</p>
