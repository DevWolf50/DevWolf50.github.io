            <p>Learning how to program is extremely rewarding but, It can also get frustrating and exhausting at times. People forget to mention that. I know I'm guilty of it as well. They say that it's the mistakes that help you grow the most. So I'm going to share with you, my top 4 mistakes trying to learn how to code.
<br>
<br>
<span class="singleChar"> Casually learning </span>
<br>
When I first had a desire to code I would watch a video and maybe try some code.
One of the biggest mistakes you can make is just casually learning to code. If you want to make a profession out of it only coding 1 -2 hours a day isn't going to cut it. The problem is that you're not getting constant exposure and there is too much opportunity for the disconnect. You really have to immerse yourself. Watch videos, read articles, listen to podcasts, go to local coding meetups and the most important of them all CODE! Applying what you are learning will help you advance the fastest. Just like learning a foreign language, you have to truly immerse yourself to have it engrained in you.
<br>
<br>
<span class="singleChar"> Coding Alone </span>
<br>
Another progress hindering mistake is coding in a box. Meaning only trying to learn on your own. Google is awesome. If we have a question we look it up and we are almost guaranteed an answer but, it also makes us forget about the power of human interaction and help. That's why one of the best things you can do is to frequently go to local meetups. These meetups are usually filled with a good mixture of expertise levels. Make friends, collaborate on projects, and find a mentor. A crucial part of the learning process is receiving feedback.
<br>
<br>
<span class="singleChar"> Not using the knowledge you gain </span>
<br>
If you could only take one of the 5 pieces of advice this would be the one to take. Early on I would watch some tutorials take some notes but, I would wait to start coding until after the section was over. Big mistake. Often times I would forget the concept and have to rewatch. That's why whenever you read an article or watch a tutorial immediately try it out and keep trying. You don't even have to make a full application. A cool tool like Code Pen allows you to jump in and start to code without all the setup and you can just code out certain components. Not only will it help you retain the new pieces of knowledge but, you'll start to build up a good portfolio that you can show off to future employers. Rember perfect practice make perfect!
<br>
<br>
<span class="singleChar"> Getting lost in the trees </span>
<br>
The world of programming is huge! there's web development, mobile, networking, desktop applications, and many more.
Then within each field there's usually different areas of concentration; making it easy to feel overwhelmed and distracted. In the beginning you feel like you need to learn it all but, don't. Focus in one particular subject, master it and move on. For example; With web development you have  design, frontend, and backend. I chose frontend in to start with. Then I Focused in on javascript. After I built a good understanding I moved on to CSS and so forth. Once you have built up the smaller pieces you add them together to get an understanding of the bigger picture.
<br>
<br>
I hope I gave you something to think about. Now go forth and build something!</p>
