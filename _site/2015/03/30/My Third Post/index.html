            <p>hey this is the last time im trying this for real though. So I'm almost done with the asthetic of the blog. All I really have to do is finish styling this blog post page and everything should be good to go!!! Im a little exited about almost finishing this project and to actually start blogging. After the styling Im going to work on the animations, which Im going to put alot of focus on that. I also want to be able to change the colors easily so ill probably set up an easy portal. IM a little tired lol. Using sketch made it really easy to take the styles I had already created and convert it over to html and css. Im liking this whole development thing. Yesterday I took a look at remote jobs yesterday and there are so many. Im super exited to get get a job.
