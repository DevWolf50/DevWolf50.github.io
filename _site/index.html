    <p><h2>I'm not a blogger</h2>


<p><br>
Wether your'e a friend,family or stranger some how you managed to find this blog and I'm very glad you've decided to poke around. You wont regret it. This is my first time blogging and if you evered blogged before you might feel like how I feel right now: The extreme pride that i felt after working hours upon hours building and finally finishing this blog was short lived once it was time to produce content. How is it easier to code a blog then it is to write a simple blog post? Thats what I asked my wife and her response was "well than why did you spend all that time building something you're not good at? She was right. But, the only reason why I'm not good at it is because I've never done it before. And the only way to get good at it is to do it. So here here I am and here you are.
<br>
<br></p>

<p><h2>So what am I?<h2>
<br>
 I was grown in southern california, matured in NorthWest Arkansas, and discovering myself in Salt Lake City. I'm a husband to an amazing woman and a father to two beautiful children. Profesinally, I've been a business analyst(I try to make sense of all the data our world is filled with ) for the past 4 years.</p>
